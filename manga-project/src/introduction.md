# Introduction

Welcome to the **Tempered In Hate (TIH)** world-building and story planning documentation.

## Purpose

This book was created to gather my thoughts and serve as the central repository for everything related to Tempered In Hate. What started as scattered ideas is now becoming a structured world, and this documentation will eventually contain the entirety of the story - everything from mediocre details to major plot points.

This living document contains:

- **Character profiles** - Detailed information about protagonists, antagonists, and supporting characters
- **World building** - Geography, power systems, races, politics, and lore
- **Plot planning** - Story arcs, timelines, conflicts, and chapter outlines
- **Relationship maps** - How characters interact and relate to each other
- **Development notes** - Ideas, concepts, and narrative elements to explore

**Future Plans:**
- Once I develop the skill or have the resources, I plan to include character artwork and visual references for each character
- This is being built with the hope that one day, Tempered In Hate will be published
- My dream is that this story gains traction and culminates into something meaningful

> **Tip:** Use the search function (top bar) to quickly find specific characters, locations, or concepts across all sections.
